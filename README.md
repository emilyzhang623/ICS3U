# ICS3U
This includes the major projects that I have created in my ICS3U course where we learned Java:
- Input, Output and Processing in Java
- Selection
- Repetition
- Methods
- Strings and Arrays
- Object-Oriented Programming

# Hailstones
- fully functional error trapped hailstones number game
- use of functions, OOP, loops and logical operators

The hailstone numbers are a sequence of numbers found according to the following rules:
the first number must be a positive integer
subsequent numbers are calculated as follows
if the current value is odd, you multiply it by 3 and add 1, otherwise you divide it by 2
the sequence stops when you get to 1
For example, if you start with 7, then the sequence is:
 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
- the player with the highest overall value in the sequence gets 5 points
- the player with the longer sequence of numbers gets points for each extra number he/she has over the opponent.

# Mastermind
- functional mastermind game with a pretty user interface
- practicing the use of string manipulation and multi-dimensional arrays
- error trapped
